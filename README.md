## About The Project

Real Estate CMS is a real estate listing platform. My goals for this project are:

-   Create a fully featured project.
-   Apply the conventions and best practices when coding.
-   Allow a highly customizable website for the user.
-   Showcase properties and their amenities to visitors.
-   Allow the user to list properties.
-   Practice good UI/UX flow.
-   Improve my knowledge at laravel.

Real Estate CMS it is a personal project, it's not my first laravel project, but it's my first solo project.
